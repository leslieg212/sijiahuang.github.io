I am a Ph.D. student at Rowan University's APA-accredited Clinical Psychology program. Prior to joining Rowan, I completed my Master's in Psychology at Columbia University, and my Bachelor's in Psychology (with a minor in Humanities) at New York University Shanghai.

Currently, under the supervision of Dr. DJ Angelone and Dr. Meredith Jones at the [ASSeRT Lab](https://www.rowanassert.com), I am working on studies about sexual dysfunction and sexual violence perpetration, barriers of engaging in health care among young moms, and alcohol administration and decision-making in a lab paradigm setting.

During my undergraduate studies at New York University Shanghai, I worked with Dr. Pekka Santtila, Dr. Thomas J. Nyman, and Dr. Patrick Jern, on studies about Sensate Focus sex therapy, masturbation and sexual dysfunction, and digital mental health.

I am also a native speaker of Mandarin Chinese and Sichuanese.
