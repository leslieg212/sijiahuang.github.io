**Symposium Learning Objectives** <br/>
1. Analyze how individual-level factors—including childhood sexual abuse (CSA), internalized homophobia (IH), sexual self-esteem, dating motives, and SV history—affect sexual violence (SV) risk perception among men who have sex with men (MSM) using dating and sexual networking (DSN) apps. <br/>

2. Evaluate the role of community affiliation and minority stress in influencing MSM’s ability to detect SV risk cues in simulated DSN app interactions. <br/>

3. Discuss implications of SV risk perception research for the development of targeted prevention strategies and interventions to enhance safety and informed decision-making within DSN environments for MSM. <br/>



**Symposium Overview** <br/>
The proposed symposium includes four presentations about a mixed methods study to develop a bogus dating and sexual networking (DSN) app (“G-Date”) to investigate sexual violence (SV) risk perception in men who have sex with men (MSM). Our team recruited 248 young MSM to interact with two bogus speed dating partners whose responses were scripted to be risky or safe. Risky dates demonstrated cues for SV perpetration in three categories: substance misuse, antisocial personality, and internalized homophobia. Risk perception was measured via the number of risk cues a participant tolerated (behavioral response), changes in pre- and post-date ratings of their date’s attractiveness, personality appeal, and interest in meeting (threat appraisal), as well as identification of the presence of risk cues (partner comparison). <br/>

MSM’s ability to detect SV risk as they navigate DSN apps serves as the outcome variable in all four presentations. The first talk discusses the influence of child sexual abuse history and internalized homonegativity on risk perception. The second talk focuses on the influence of internalized homophobia (IH)  and LGBTQ+ community affiliation on risk perception. The third talk examines the role of sexual self-esteem and dating motives on risk perception. The final talk focuses on how adult involvement in SV, including victimization and/or perpetration history, affects risk perception. For each presentation, speakers will discuss implications for SV prevention particularly in DSN environments. <br/>

**Associations between Sexual Self-Esteem, Dating Motives, and Risk Perception** <br/>
**Abstract** <br/>
_Introduction_ <br/>
As many as 30% of individuals who use DSN apps have had an unwanted sexual experience as a result of their app use (Filice et al., 2022). One predictor of SV victimization is low sexual self-esteem (Schuster et al., 2022; Wong et al., 2020). Dating motives are also related to risky sexual behaviors, such as higher odds of unprotected sex and contracting STI (Flesia et al., 2021). The current study aims at investigating the association between sexual self-esteem and SV risk perception, and whether the relationship is affected by dating motives. <br/>

_Method_ <br/>
The subscale of sexual-esteem from the Sexuality Scale (Snell JR. & Papini, 1989) was used to measure participants’ sexual self-esteem. The Intent to Use Dating Apps Scale (Chan, 2017) was used to measure participants’ dating motives, consisting of “romantic motives” and “sexual motives.” The number of risk cues a participant tolerated served as the outcome. <br/>

_Results_ <br/>
Linear regression was conducted to investigate whether sexual self-esteem, romantic motives, and sexual motives predicted risk perception. An ANOVA model comparison showed that adding interactions did not significantly improve the model fit. Sexual self-esteem and sexual motives had no significant main effects (p > .50). Higher scores of romantic motives were associated with lower scores of risk perception, although this effect was marginally significant B = -0.50, SE = 0.26, t(238) = -1.91, p = .058. <br/>

_Conclusions_ <br/>
Our preliminary findings suggest that neither sexual self-esteem and sexual motives alone nor the interactions of sexual self-esteem and dating motives are related to the ability of risk perception. However, participants with stronger motives of looking for romantic partners tended to have poorer SV risk perception. <br/>
