**Abstract**<br/>
_Introduction_ <br/>
Hookup among US college students is on the rise, with varying degrees of hookup frequency and motives. While some are seeking casual sex for sexual pleasure, some may be using hookup as a coping strategy. Previous research suggests that the use of dating and hook-up apps are associated with poor body image and unhealthy weight control behaviors (Strubel & Petrie, 2017; Tran et al., 2019; Winter et al., 2021). Also, having eating disorders or distorted eating patterns were associated with multiple new sexual partners and more unprotected sex among young women (Fergus et al., 2019). However, little is known about if hookup is directly related to eating disorders. The current study aims at filling the gap by investigating whether hookup behaviors and motives differ for those with and without eating disorders, as well as examining if body image mediates the relationship between them. <br/>

_Method_ <br/>
Participants were 273 college students (mean age = 21.2, gender: 36.3% male, 59% female, 4.8% other) from a large Northeastern U.S. public university who completed surveys about health-related behaviors on campus during the 2021 academic year. To assess hookup frequency, we asked how often participants hookup and when was the last time that they hooked up with someone. Next, we used Hooking Up Motives Questionnaire (Kenney et al., 2014) and Hookup Consequences Measure (Napper et al., 2015) to examine their hookup motivations and consequences. Eating disorder was measured by Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (Luce & Crowther, 1999) and body image was measured by Body Image Quality of Life Inventory (Cash & Fleming, 2002). <br/>

_Results_ <br/>
A series of Pearson Correlations were computed to investigate the associations between eating disorder and body image, hookup frequency, hookup consequences, and hookup motives. Results showed that there was a positive correlation between eating disorders and hookup negative consequences r(145) = .193, p =.020. However, no associations were found between body image and hookup behaviors, as well as eating disorders and hookup frequency. Next, Independent Samples t-tests were conducted to examine the differences of hookup behaviors among those with and without eating disorders. Results showed that those with eating disorders (M = 3.49, SD = 4.68) reported significantly more hookup negative consequences compared to those without eating disorders (M = 1.45, SD = 2.90), t(42.64) = -2.434, p = .019. Also, those with eating disorders (M = 2.07, SD =1.18) indicated higher levels of hookup coping motive than those without eating disorders (M = 1.59, SD = 0.97), t(168) = -2.576, p = .011. <br/>

_Conclusions_ <br/>
Although eating disorders did not have significant correlation with hookup frequency, our results suggest that college students with eating disorders are more likely to engage in hookup because of coping reasons and are also more likely to experience negative consequences after hookups. This study highlights the importance for eating disorder patients to develop healthy coping mechanisms and provides clinical implications in addressing sexual health concerns for those with mental disorders. <br/>
