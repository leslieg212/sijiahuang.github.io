**Abstract**<br/>
This study aims to investigate how sexual dysfunction affects relationship satisfaction and sexual satisfaction for Chinese adults who are currently in a relationship. We found that for both men and women, the happier they are with their relationship, the more satisfied they are with their sex life and the fewer sexual dysfunctions they have, and vice versa. Also, the longer the relationship is, the fewer sexual dysfunctions one has. For men, ejaculation problems are associated with erectile dysfunction. Those findings suggest that sexual dysfunction does cause dissatisfaction in people’s sex life and longer relationship is likely to lead to less performance anxiety. <br/>
