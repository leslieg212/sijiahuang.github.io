**Abstract**<br/>
<p style="padding-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 0;">
Sensate Focus (SF) exercises (Masters & Johnson, 1966, 1970) are widely used by sex therapists for treating sexual dysfunction with empirical evidence of efficacy even though some of the evidence comes from low quality designs. Also, no previous research has examined if SF exercises can work without therapist intervention. We investigated whether web-based, animation-demoed SF exercises could enhance Chinese heterosexual couples’ intimacy, relationship and sexual satisfaction. <br/>
  </p>
<p style="padding-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em; margin-left: 0;">
We have recruited 15 couples (15 men and 15 women) so far (additional 15 couples are being recruited) allocated to an experimental or a waitlist-control group. Measures assessed at pre-intervention, post-intervention and three month follow-up include Checklist for Early Ejaculation Symptoms and International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire-5 for men and Female Sexual Function Index for women, Interpersonal Exchange Model of Sexual Satisfaction Questionnaire, Relationship Assessment Scale, and Personal Assessment of Intimacy in Relationships for all participants. The intervention consists of eleven SF animation videos modeling 11 exercises, such as gazing, hugging, Kegel exercise, non-genital touching, and genital touching. Participants do these exercises for 2-4 hours per week, five weeks in total, reporting their progress to the researchers. <br/>

In preliminary pre-post comparisons, the intervention significantly increased relationship satisfaction and intimacy. Women reported improved scores in the Female Sexual Function Index and men reported improved erectile function. This suggests that non-demanding touch exercises delivered online may have brought the couple closer and may have made sex more spontaneous, which resulted in less performance anxiety and improvement in arousal-related sexual function. <br/>
